# Project Info
The goal of this addon is to provide easy access to tools, functions, panels 
 or anything that may stand in the way of a fast workflow

 Whether it means auto selections, automated mode changes,
  allowing access to pannels that are not available in certain modes etc.

# Version And Version Standard
**For clarity sake both for users and new contributors this version structure will be preferable when commiting**

 + v0.0.x for bug fixes and simple code restructuring
   
+ v0.x.0 for new addition that expand the reach of addon 

+ vx.0.0 for major changes, completion of a system's coverage, or in case of major optimization/code rewrites

with a(alpha) and b(beta) for changes that are possibly unstable/need more testing respectively

# Code Changes And Contribution
*note:* `main_branch_latest` does not correspond to the lastes commit rather it's used to maintain a "static" download link for the release page across sites
The **_main_** branch has been set to be read-only to not hinder the main line of development
Pull requests are the core of where changes can be proposed so that they can be verified

Before Rasing an issue check discussions, or issues with [dev_bug_notice](https://github.com/Valery-AA/AlxOverHaul/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22dev+bug+notice%22)
keeping the list of issues as clean as possible will make spotting actual bugs much easier
