# Project Info
	The goal of this addon is to provide easy access to tools, functions, panels or
    anything that may stand in the way of a fast workflow

 	whether it means auto selections, automated mode changes, access to pannel that are not available in certain modes for selection conflicts etc.

 	no custom tools are planned at the moment and focus will remain on requests and other(at personal or contributor necessity)

# Version And Version Standard
	For clarity sake both for users and new contributors this version structure will be preferable when commiting

 	- v0.0.x for bug fixes and simple code restructuring, with a(alpha) and b(beta) for changes that are possibly unstable/need more testing respectively
  	- v0.x.0 for new addition that expand the reach of addon i.e.: the addition of a tool to an area of blender in a system that wasn't touched before
   	- vx.0.0 for major changes, completion of a system's coverage, or in case of major optimization/code rewrites
